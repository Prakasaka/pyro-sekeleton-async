# Kittenz – Pyro-Skeleton-Async:
This project was built to demonstrate how we at [@baivaru](https://t.me/Baivaru) structures - 
our async [pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) projects. I could have written a skeleton (directory structures, modules 
showing where plugins are loaded from and etc) which you could simply clone and build upon it. 
However, doing that could have left you halfway through the whole purpose of “making it easier” 
and having a skeleton. Therefore, the following project is a fully functional [bot](https://t.me/Kittenzbot) that would demonstrate 
most of the common methods, functionalities [pyrogram](https://docs.pyrogram.org/) offers you to start programing a simple telegram bot 
and some clean practices that we at [@baivaru](https://t.me/Baivaru) follow which you could refer and imply with your projects.

## Cloning & Run:
1. `git clone https://github.com/eyaadh/pyro-sekeleton-async.git`, to clone the repository.
2. `cd pyro-sekeleton-async`, to enter the directory.
3. `pip3 install -r requirments.txt`, to install the dependencies/requirements.
4. Create a new `config.ini` using the sample available at `pyro-sekeleton-async\working_dir`. Also details on the variables available bellow.
5. Run with `python3.8 -m pyro`, stop with <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.
> It is recommended to use [virtual environments](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/) while running the app, this is a good practice you can use at any of your python projects as virtualenv creates an isolated Python environment which is specific to your project.

### Directory Structures:
```
pyro-sekeleton-async/
└── pyro/
    ├── plugins/
    ├── utils/
    │   └── helpers/
    └── working_dir/
```
#### plugins:
This directory consists of Pyrogram's a smart, lightweight yet powerful plugin's which enables 
us to simplify and organize large projects with modular base components. More in regards to 
smart plugins can be found [here.](https://docs.pyrogram.org/topics/smart-plugins) 

#### utils:
The name utils define exactly what this directory is for. All the utilities that helps the 
application to work through is kept in this directory, such as DB module (if that exists), a module called common 
which loads the required external variables(mostly configurations from configs.ini) and etc.

##### helpers:
Helpers directory consists of modules that connects to 3rd party APIs to help the application gather 
the data it requires.

#### working_dir:
This directory basically consists of the config.ini file/s, the session file/s generated by the 
application. Also if there are temporary files that are generated by the directory we tend to leave them 
within this directory at the course of their existence.

### Config.ini Variables:
